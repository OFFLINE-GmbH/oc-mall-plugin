## Documentation

The raw documentation for this plugin is stored in the docs directory. It is written in markdown and 
built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev).

For a live preview of the docs visit the `plugins/offline/mall` directory and install the necessary 
dependencies using `npm i`. Now you can run the local development server with `npm run docs:dev`.

## Bugs and feature requests

If you found a bug or want to request a feature please file a GitHub issue.

## Pull requests

PRs are always welcome! Open them against the `develop` branch.
If you plan a time consuming contribution please open an issue first and describe what changes you 
have in mind.
