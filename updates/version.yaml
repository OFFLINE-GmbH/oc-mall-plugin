        !!! A product can now belong to multiple categories. If you are using the `$product->category`
        relationship directly make sure to update it to use the new `$product->categories` relationship.
        Existing products will be migrated and re-indexed during this update. If you have many products
        (more than a few hundred) you should run `php artisan october:update` from the command line to
        get more feedback on this update.
