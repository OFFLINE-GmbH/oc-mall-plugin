# Categories

Categories are used to organize [Products](./products.md) in your store. They also define the [Properties](
./properties.md) that will be available for all related Products.

Categories can be nested. Every Category needs to be given an `Name` and a `URL`. An optional `Code` for programmatic
 access and a `image` can be provided.
 
 ## Property groups
 
 By adding [Property groups](./properties.md) to a Category you can define the "Schema" of related Products.
 
 If the current Category is `Shirts`, the `Size` and `Color` Property groups can be added. As a result, every Product
  in the `Shirts` category will have all `Size` and `Color` properties available.
