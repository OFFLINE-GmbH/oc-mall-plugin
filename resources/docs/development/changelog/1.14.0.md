# v1.14.0

## Changes

Added support for PHP 8.

To make future transitions easier, optional dependencies for this plugin
are now only "suggested" and not enforced using Composer.

## Required actions

### Check your composer dependencies

If you are using any of the optional features of the plugin, make sure
to manually install the required packages using composer after this update.
