# v1.13.0

## Changes

Switched the default Stripe payment provider to use Stripe's [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents)

This now supports Strong Customer Authtentication (SCA) and 3D Secure payment flows.

## Required actions

### Test a Stripe payment

The switch to the new API should not require you to change anything.
To make sure your Stripe account is configured correctly, test this
version against Stripe's test API before deploying it to production.
