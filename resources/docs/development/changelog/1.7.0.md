# v1.7.0

## Changes

* Added support for [Virtual Products](../digging-deeper/virtual-products.md)

## Required actions

### `Checkout` Component

The `shippingmethod.htm` partial only displays a method if the user's cart consists not exclusively of virutal products.
If you do not override this partial no action is required.

See [Commit](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/commit/95e93dd96998b71fce665a12aa65d75a83258248#diff-e8cf26df26eeb4db9c1398b4479dc8e1)

### `Signup` Component

If you have extended or customized the `Signup` component, make sure to check for the new `mall.login.redirect` Session entry
for any pending redirects.

However, it is very unlikely that you modified this component yourself. 

See [Commit](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/commit/c961a51e15b82af6198a2a23a6f1059bf6fcd572)

### `order.table` mail partial

The order table mail partial contains a new info about the download
link of virtual products. 

Add this if you customized to partial and plan to use virtual products.
