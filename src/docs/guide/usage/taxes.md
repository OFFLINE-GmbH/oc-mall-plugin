Taxes can be applied to [Products and Variants](/guide/usage/products), [Shipping methods](/guide/usage/shipping-methods) and [Payment 
methods](/guide/usage/payment-methods).

They can be optionally restricted to specific countries. If such a restriction is defined, the tax will only be 
applied if an order is shipped to one of the selected countries. Otherwise the tax will be ignored.

Countries that have no restrictions will be applied worldwide.

You can manage all taxes via `Backend settings > Mall: General > Taxes`.
