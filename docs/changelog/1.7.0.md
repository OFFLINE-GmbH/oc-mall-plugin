# v1.6.0

## Changes

* Added [Reviews](../digging-deeper/reviews.md) feature 

## Required actions

### Reviews are opt-in for existing installations

If you update to v1.6.0, you have to enable reviews via the backend settings. 
This will include the new `ProductReviews` component, which you will have to style!

### `product` Component

The form tag was moved to only enclose the cart part of the component.
If you did not override these partials no action is required.
