# v1.7.0

## Changes

* Added support for [virtual Products](../digging-deeper/reviews.md) feature 

## Required actions

### `Checkout` Component

The shippingmethod.htm partial only displays a method if the user's cart consists not exclusively of virutal products.

See [Commit](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/commit/95e93dd96998b71fce665a12aa65d75a83258248#diff-e8cf26df26eeb4db9c1398b4479dc8e1)

### `Signup` Component

If you have extended or customized the Signup component, make sure to check for the new `mall.login.redirect` Session entry
for any pending redirects.

It is very unlikely, that you have made changes to this method.
