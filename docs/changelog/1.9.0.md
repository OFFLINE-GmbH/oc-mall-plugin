# v1.9.0

## Changes

* PHP7.2 is now required to run this plugin
* You can now set a default tax that is used if the shipping destination country is not known yet

## Required actions

### Update RainLab.Translate 

Update `RainLab.Translate` to version `1.6.3` to be compatible
with this release. 

Version `1.6.3` enables eager-loading of translated attributes.
This decreases the overall query count on all pages enormously. 

### Update product component partials

If you override the `properties/color.htm` or `properties/default.htm`
partials of the `Product` component, make sure to use 
new value accessors to properly load translations.

See [Commit](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/commit/4ba95c8808dda658e255d2688efaeae69f5ec8e9)

If you overrides the `tax-info.htm` partial of the `Product` component,
make sure to uses the new `filteredTaxes` attribute to only display the
correct taxes for the user's current shipping destination country.
