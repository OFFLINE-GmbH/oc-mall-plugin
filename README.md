## Benchmarks

Below are some totally unscientific benchmarks created on a lazy Saturday afternoon. 
These tests were run on a DigitalOcean CPU optimized Droplet with 2 vCPU and 4GB RAM.
October was run on Ubuntu 18.04, PHP 7.2.10, Apache 2.4.19 and MySQL 5.7.24.

All measurements were done using the [Bedard.Debugbar](https://octobercms.com/plugin/bedard-debugbar) 
plugin and are the average load time over 10 page loads (I told you they were unscientific!).
 
`Index size` defines the size of the `offline_mall_index` table. This table includes de-normalized 
information about all Products and Variants. An index size of 1000 means there are 1000 
individual Variants and Products stored. The demo data used was built using the 
 `php artisan mall:seed-demo` command run in an infinite loop.

`Category page load` is the page load time measured when a category page is loaded. 
All stored products will be filtered, sorted (by sales count) and counted by the currently viewed `category_id`.
Nine of these products will be displayed and the pagination will be built based on the returned number
of results.

`Filtered page load` is the page load time measured when two filters are being enabled
 (filter by the color `Red` and the material `Carbon`). In this case all products
will be filtered by their category, their color and their material. The pagination
will be built based on the returned number of results.

| Index size | Category page load | Filtered page load |
| ---------: | -----------------: | -----------------: |
|      1'000 |             290 ms |             281 ms |
|      5'000 |             301 ms |             295 ms |
|     10'000 |             324 ms |             318 ms |
|     50'000 |             448 ms |             433 ms |
|    100'000 |             586 ms |             570 ms |
|    200'000 |             912 ms |             865 ms |
|    300'000 |            1300 ms |            1240 ms |

Please be aware that these benchmarks are only here to show you how this plugin
behaves under different loads and the times will vary depending on the
hardware, configuration and setup of your installation. If you really want to know how well
the plugin performs install it yourself and give it a go!
