The plugin was originally developed by [OFFLINE GmbH](https://offline.ch). In the past years it has been
improved and extended by the October CMS community.

The following maintainers are currently working actively on the plugin:

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+ | 8.0+
- OctoberCMS 2.2+ | v3.0+
- MySQL 5.7+ | v8.0+ or MariaDB v10.2+ or SQLite v3.19+

We highly recommend not using SQLite on production environments, especially for larger Shops.

There is also a [legacy version](https://github.com/OFFLINE-GmbH/oc-mall-plugin/tree/v1) of this 
plugin available, that works with OctoberCMS v1. However, this version is no longer updated nor 
supported.


## Support

For support and development requests please file an issue on GitHub.


## Installation

The easiest way to get you started is by using the command line:

```bash
composer require \
   rainlab/user-plugin \
   rainlab/location-plugin \
   rainlab/translate-plugin \
   offline/oc-mall-plugin
``` 

Once the plugin is installed take a look at [the official documentation](https://offline-gmbh.github.io/oc-mall-plugin/)
to get everything up and running.


## Benchmarks

Below are some totally unscientific benchmarks created on a lazy Saturday afternoon. These tests 
were run on a DigitalOcean CPU optimized Droplet with 2 vCPU and 4GB RAM. October was run on Ubuntu 1
8.04, PHP 7.2.10, Apache 2.4.19 and MySQL 5.7.24.

All measurements were done using the [Bedard.Debugbar](https://octobercms.com/plugin/bedard-debugbar) 
plugin and are the average load time over 10 page loads (I told you they were unscientific!).
 
`Index size` defines the size of the `offline_mall_index` table. This table includes de-normalized 
information about all Products and Variants. An index size of 1000 means there are 1000 individual 
Variants and Products stored. The demo data used was built using the  `php artisan mall:seed-demo` 
command run in an infinite loop.

`Category page load` is the page load time measured when a category page is loaded. All stored 
products will be filtered, sorted (by sales count) and counted by the currently viewed `category_id`.
Nine of these products will be displayed and the pagination will be built based on the returned 
number of results.

`Filtered page load` is the page load time measured when two filters are being enabled (filter by 
the color `Red` and the material `Carbon`). In this case all products will be filtered by their 
category, their color and their material. The pagination will be built based on the returned number 
of results.

| Index size | Category page load | Filtered page load |
| ---------: | -----------------: | -----------------: |
|      1'000 |             290 ms |             281 ms |
|      5'000 |             301 ms |             295 ms |
|     10'000 |             324 ms |             318 ms |
|     50'000 |             448 ms |             433 ms |
|    100'000 |             586 ms |             570 ms |
|    200'000 |             912 ms |             865 ms |
|    300'000 |            1300 ms |            1240 ms |

Please be aware that these benchmarks are only here to show you how this plugin behaves under 
different loads and the times will vary depending on the hardware, configuration and setup of your 
installation. If you really want to know how well the plugin performs install it yourself and give 
it a go!
